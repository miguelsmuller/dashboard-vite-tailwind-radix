# **Dashboard React Vite Tailwind Radix**

## **Overview**
A repository to keep a study project for the development of a dashboard using Vite/ReactJS, Tailwind and Radix.

**[ReactJS](https://pt-br.reactjs.org/)**  makes creating interactive UIs an easy task. Create simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render only the necessary components as the data changes.

**[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)** aims to resolve the availability of native ES modules in the browser and the emergence of JavaScript tools written in natively compiled languages.

**[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)** is a utility-first framework package with classes that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.

### **To-do**

## **Special Thanks**
This study is based on the content made by **[Adam Wathan](https://github.com/adamwathan)** *(Creator of Tailwind CSS)* in his **[Live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xgMkGMIudE)** in his **[ YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy1H38XrN7hi7wHSClfXPqQ)**.

I'm just starting with Tailwind CSS but I can only thank Adam for the work he did. He really does an excellent job with Tailwind and his videos.
